#IndexedDB with image and video Blobs

Example Django web app to understand the basics of using blobs with IndexedDB. We try to store image, mp4 and webm blobs to our IndexedDB storage and then view them on the webpage by retrieving them from the same database.

In order to run this app, clone the repo. and change the directory to this web app:

```
cd saving_image_video
python3 manage.py runserver
```

After this, open the localhost URL as provided in your terminal and go to /myblob.html
(Usually http://localhost:8000/myblob.html)
